# **Project Overview**

### **Objective**

The Coffee Sales Dashboard project focused on analyzing sales data from the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland, encompassing various aspects such as coffee roast types, quantity sold, profit margins, total sales, and customer information. The project aimed to provide stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, enhance customer relationships, and drive profitability within the coffee industry.

# Data Collection and Scope:
Data collection primarily consisted of sales transactions from coffee retailers across the specified regions, capturing key metrics including coffee roast types, quantity sold, revenue generated, and customer details such as names, email addresses, and customer IDs. The dataset was limited to sales transactions within the specified geographic areas to ensure relevance and accuracy in the analysis.

# Analysis and Insights:
Using Excel, I aggregated and analyzed the collected sales data to identify trends and patterns across different variables. By leveraging pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting, I visualized key metrics such as sales performance by roast type, geographical distribution of customers, and profitability trends over time. 

# Key Findings:

- Roast Type Analysis: We observed variations in sales volume and profitability across different coffee roast types, with preferences differing between regions.
- Geographical Trends: The analysis revealed geographic differences in customer demographics and purchasing patterns, influencing sales strategies and marketing efforts.
- Customer Segmentation: By segmenting customers based on their purchasing behaviour and preferences, I identified opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized customer experiences.

# Conclusion:

The Coffee Sales Dashboard project provided valuable insights into sales trends, customer behaviour, and profitability within the coffee industry across the US, UK, and Ireland. By leveraging data-driven analysis, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business success in the competitive coffee market.
